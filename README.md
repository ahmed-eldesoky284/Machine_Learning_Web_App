# Machine Learning Web App with PyCaret and Streamlit

This is a web application built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications, and PyCaret, an open-source, low-code machine learning library designed to automate machine learning workflows.

## Overview

The app allows users to upload a CSV file containing their dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), select the target variable, and choose between classification or regression models for training. The application leverages PyCaret's AutoML feature to identify the best machine learning model for the given dataset.

## Features

- Upload CSV file
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Select Target Variable
- Choose Model Type (Classification or Regression)
- Train Machine Learning Models
- View Best Model

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-edlesoky284/Machine_Learning_Web_App.git

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. **Run Streamlit App:**
   streamlit run main.py


4. **Use the App:**
- Upload your dataset in CSV format.
- Explore the data with EDA.
- Select the target variable and model type.
- Train the machine learning models.
- View the best model selected by PyCaret.
